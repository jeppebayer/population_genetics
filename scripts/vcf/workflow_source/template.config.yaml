# (str). The name of the relevant project account.
account: 
# (str). Taxonomic group. Can be left empty.
taxonomic_group: 
# (str). Name of species being analyzed.
species_name: 
# (str). Path to reference genome.
reference_genome_path: 
# (str). BED file indicating intergenic regions of the reference genome.
intergenic_bed_file: 
# (str). BED file indicating repetitive regions of the reference genome. If left empty workflow will try to extract repetitive regions from reference genome.
repeats_bed_file: 
# (str). Directory for intermediary files.
working_directory_path: 
# (str). Directory for final output files. (If left empty, output file will be placed within 'working_directory_path').
output_directory_path: 
# (int). Partition size of genome in base pairs. If left empty defaults to '500000'.
partition_size: 
# Variant caller, Freebayes settings.
freebayes_settings:
  # (int). sample_ploidy = ploidy * n_individials. If left empty defaults to '100'.
  sample_ploidy: 
  # (int). Number of variants to consider and report when multiple are available. If left empty defaults to '3'
  best_n_alleles: 
  # (0 | float). Lower threshold fraction for variant to be considered. If left empty defaults to '0'.
  min_alternate_fraction: 
  # (int). Lower threshold count for variant to be considered. If left empty defaults to '2'.
  min_alternate_count: 
  # (int). Amount of memory, in GB, to reserve per VCF partition. If left empty defaults to '80'.
  memory: 
  # (str). Amount of time to reserve per VCF partition in format: 'tt:mm:ss'. If left empty defaults to '48:00:00'.
  time: 
# Filtering settings.
filtering:
  # (int). Minimum required depth, inclusive.
  minimum_depth: 
# (int). Mode for creating VCF file (1 | 2 | 3 | 4).
# 1 = Separate VCF files for each sample/BAM file. 2 = One VCF file per sample group. 3 = One VCF containing data for all samples/BAM files. 4 = All.
mode: 
# Batch settings. Can be used to reduced the number of jobs sent to the queue at one time.
# Only partial VCF files will be created when batching. To complete the full workflow one must do a no-batch run.
batch_settings:
  # (int). The number of batches to create. 0 = don't batch jobs. If left empty defaults to '0'
  number_of_batches: 
  # (int). Which of the created batches to run. Must be >=1 AND <=number_of_batches. Can be left empty if number_of_batches is '0'.
  current_batch_number: 
# (list). Sample setup. List of dictionaries listing the configuration for each sample.
sample_list:
  - 
    # (str). Name of sample group.
    group_name: 
    # (list). List of paths to BAM files.
