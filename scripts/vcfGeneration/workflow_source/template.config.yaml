# (str). The name of the relevant project account.
account: 
# (str). Taxonomic group. Can be left empty.
taxonomicGroup: 
# (str). Name of species being analyzed.
speciesName: 
# (str). Path to reference genome.
referenceGenomePath: 
# (str). BED file indicating intergenic regions of the reference genome.
intergenicBedFile: 
# (str). BED file indicating repetitive regions of the reference genome. If left empty workflow will try to extract repetitive regions from reference genome.
repeatsBedFile: 
# (str). Directory for intermediary files.
workingDirectoryPath: 
# (str). Directory for final output files. (If left empty, output file will be placed within 'workingDirectoryPath').
outputDirectoryPath: 
# (int). Partition size of genome in base pairs. If left empty defaults to '500000'.
partitionSize: 
# Variant caller, Freebayes settings.
freebayesSettings:
  # (int). samplePloidy = ploidy * n_individials. If left empty defaults to '100'.
  samplePloidy: 
  # (int). Number of variants to consider and report when multiple are available. If left empty defaults to '3'
  bestNAlleles: 
  # (0 | float). Lower threshold fraction for variant to be considered. If left empty defaults to '0'.
  minAlternateFraction: 
  # (int). Lower threshold count for variant to be considered. If left empty defaults to '2'.
  minAlternateCount: 
  # (int). Amount of memory, in GB, to reserve per VCF partition. If left empty defaults to '80'.
  memory: 
  # (str). Amount of time to reserve per VCF partition in format: 'tt:mm:ss'. If left empty defaults to '48:00:00'.
  time: 
# Batch settings. Can be used to reduced the number of jobs sent to the queue at one time.
# Only partial VCF files will be created when batching. To complete the full workflow one must do a no-batch run.
batchSettings:
  # (int). The number of batches to create. 0 = don't batch jobs. If left empty defaults to '0'
  numberOfBatches: 
  # (int). Which of the created batches to run. Must be >=1 AND <=numberOfBatches. Can be left empty if numberOfBatches is '0'.
  currentBatchNumber: 
# (list). Sample setup. List of dictionaries listing the configuration for each sample.
sampleList:
  - 
    # ('i' | 'o'). Whether the sample group is to be considered ingroup (i) or outgroup (o).
    groupStatus: 
    # (str). Name of sample group.
    groupName: 
    # (int). Minimum depth for samples in group. Used for depth distributions and site counts.
    groupMinDP: 
    # Lists of paths to BAM files. BAM files can be separated in two 'qualities'. If both are used; depth distribution, site counts and vcf will be
    # created for the 'high quality' samples and for for all samples combined.
    # (list). List of paths to 'high quality' BAM file.
    highQualityBamFileList:
      - 
    # (list). List of paths to 'low quality' BAM file.
